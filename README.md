## Philosophy
- **Hardware wallet-style security features**: MEWconnect stores your private keys safely in a local, isolated, and secure vault on your device to protect your account like the ELEVENTEEN GOOGILLION dollars it will one day be worth (probably).
- **Two step verification to protect your every transaction**: Everyone should be able to create a wallet and send Ether & Tokens without additional cost.
- **Phishers will have to phish somewhere else**: No one can obtain your private key. MEWconnect is official MyEtherWallet software.
- **No centralized servers**:No databases. MEWconnect and MyEtherWallet talk via P2P communication.
- **No data collection**: MyEtherWallet can’t collect your personal data even if we wanted to.
- **Open source**: Transparent, free, and open source. We serve the community. Also, all our software is independently audited by the community.
